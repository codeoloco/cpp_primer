 * Write a progran that repeatedly asks the user to enter pairs of numbers
 * until at least one of the pair is 0. For each pair, the program should
 * use a function to calculate the hormonic means of the numbers. The function
 * should return the answer to main(), which should report it. The harmonic
 * mean of the numbers is the inverse of the average of the inverses and can
 * be calculated as follows:
 *
 * harmonic mean = 2.0 * x * y /Â (x + y)
 *
